This page will take you step by step through solving challenge 8.

## Solution Steps:
First we will make sure they are all reporting to our demo Log Analytics Workspace.
- To do that go to our Resource group, open the Log Analytics Workspace
- Go to Virtual Machines and put your 5 unique characters, and see if all reporting to this one

- If not, click the VM, disconnected it and re-connected to this LA WS.
- Now create a new Automation Account ([here is how](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-quickstart-create-account))
- Link the Automation Account to your Log Analytics Workspace, go to the newly created Azure Automation Account, go to update management and link the LA WS as shown below
  
![enter image description here](https://github.com/msghaleb/AzureMonitorHackathon/raw/master/images/azautoaccount.png)  
- Enable the Azure Update Management on your VMs, on the same page (you may need to refresh it) go to "Add Azure VMs"

>![enter image description here](https://github.com/msghaleb/AzureMonitorHackathon/raw/master/images/managevms.png)> Pick the option suitable for your environment
  
>**Note:** You may need to wait sometime for the VMs to show up
  
- The next step is to schedule an update deployment. Open the automation account. In the left menu, select **Update Management**.

- Under the **Machines** tab. Under the **Update Deployments** tab, you can see the status of past scheduled deployments. Under the **Deployment schedules** tab, you can see a list of upcoming and completed deployments.
  
- Select **Schedule update deployment**. The **New update deployment** window will open, and you can specify the needed information.

Here is more information about the different options ([click here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/update-management/deploy-updates))

Once you specify all settings, select **Create**.

Fill it up, click create - you are all set ;-)

To see the status of an update deployment, select the **Update deployments** tab under **Update management**. **In progress** indicates that deployment is currently running. When the deployment is completed, the status will show either “Succeeded” if each update was deployed successfully or “Partially failed” if there were errors for one or more of the updates.

To see all the details of the update deployment, click on the update deployment from available list.


  
**The Bonus part (Optional)**
