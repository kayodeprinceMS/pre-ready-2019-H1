>**Tips:**
Use **Add text** to describe the upcoming table
Use **Add parameters** to create the time selector
Use **Add query** to retrieve data from pageViews
Use **Column Settings** to change labels of column headers and use Bar and Threshold visualizations.

Add the following time parameter:

pageViews
| summarize pageSamples = count(itemCount), pageTimeAvg = avg(duration), pageTimeMax = max(duration) by name
| sort by pageSamples desc
```    
- And the following Query: (Request Failures)  
```
requests
| where success == false
| summarize total_count=sum(itemCount), pageDurationAvg=avg(duration) by name, resultCode
```

- Add another query, change the Resource Type to Log Analytics
- Change your workspace to the LA workspace with your AKS container logs
 
Add this query which is used for section Disk Used Percentage
```
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == "container.azm.ms/disk" 
| where Name == "used_percent"
| project TimeGenerated, Computer, Val 
| summarize avg(Val) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated, 1m)
| render timechart
```
  

Should look like that:
